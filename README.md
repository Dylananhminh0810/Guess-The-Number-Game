# Guess-The-Number-Game
The game that you need to guess a number. You have 20 hp to survive and guess the correct value from 1 to 20. I just start to learn JS and this game is a practice.

If you get the right value, it change the screen color and show the correct value.

When you click play again it reset everything except the highscore value.

And once you lose, it pops up a message and change the screen color to gray.
